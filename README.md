I am a biomedical engineer and PhD student at the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language under the supervision of [Dr. César Caballero-Gaudes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EGyN5_YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Dr. Miguel Ángel Veganzones](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=8o-d6B4AAAAJ&hl=en). I'm primarily interested in inverse problems and applying them to functional MRI data (fMRI).

I am an active contributor to [tedana](https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana), a library for denoising multi-echo fMRI data, and the [physiopy suite](https://github.com/physiopy), a set of tools to work on your physiological data as well as making it BIDS compatible. I recently released [Rica](https://github.com/ME-ICA/rica), a tool written in React to manually classify ICA components obtained with tedana and aroma. I am also the chair of [Brainhack Donostia 2020](https://brainhack-donostia.github.io).

🔭 I am currently working on methods for the spatio-temporal deconvolution of fMRI data, both single- and multi-echo, and tensor decomposition methods for the denoising of multi-echo fMRI data.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to make all things BIDS, how to make an awesome Python package on GitHub and how to make the most of [[[RoamResearch]]](https://roamresearch.com).

💬 Ask me about deconvolution, tensor decomposition, tedana, physiopy or just about anything. I am always looking to learn new things!

📫 How to reach me: you can email me or DM me on Twitter.

😄 Pronouns: he/him

⚡ Fun fact: I am a big fan of photography and rock music. I enjoy the occasional sunset photo and playing the guitar or the bass.
