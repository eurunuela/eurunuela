I am a biomedical engineer and PhD student at the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language with Dr. CÃ©sar Caballero-Gaudes ([@CesarCaballeroGaudes](https://github.com/CesarCaballeroGaudes)). I'm primarily interested in optimization problems and applying them to functional MRI data (fMRI).

I am an active contributor to [tedana](https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana), a library for denoising multi-echo fMRI data, and the [physiopy suite](https://github.com/physiopy), a set of tools to work on your physiological data as well as making it BIDS compatible. I am also the chair of [Brainhack Donostia 2020](https://brainhack-donostia.github.io)

ðŸ”­ I am currently working on methods for the spatio-temporal deconvolution of fMRI data, both single- and multi-echo, and tensor decomposition methods for the denoising of multi-echo fMRI data. I am also an active contributor to tedana and the physiopy suite.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make all things BIDS, how to make an awesome Python packge on GitHub and how to make the most of [[[RoamResearch]]](https://roamresearch.com).

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about deconvolution, tensor decomposition, tedana, physiopy or just about anything. I am always looking to learn new things!

ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can email me, DM me on Twitter.

âš¡ Fun fact: I am a big fan of photography and rock music. I enjoy the occasional sunset photo and playing the guitar or the bass.
